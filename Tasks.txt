

## The initial problem:
##The HR department asked for an easy way to organize employee data. The idea is to store each person's data in a separate file named after them so they can be easily found and retrieved. 

### Task 1
##Please create a python routine that generates a '.txt' file for each employee named after him.


## Additional request made by HR
##Out of curiosity, HR would like to discover which are the 5 most frequent first names on this list.

### Task 2
##Please print out top 5 frequent first names and the respective frequency.


## Further requirement
##They would also like to organize these files in a intuitive way, and group them in folders according to the first letter of each person's surname.

### Task 3
##Please create a folder for each letter and move the previously created files in the respective folder according to the person's surname. For example, "Jasen_Kerluke" should be moved to folder "J".

##NOTE: folders usually do not appear in the filesystem when they do not contain any files / objects.
